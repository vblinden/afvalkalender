## Afvalkalender (Waste calendar)

The waste calendar of the municipality's website did not support any adjustment of alerts. So now I generate my own calendar (based on their data), with alerts that work for me.

* I hacked this together in an hour or so. 
* This will only work for Alphen aan den Rijn in the Netherlands.
* Enjoy.
